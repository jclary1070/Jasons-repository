You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:
 
When(/^I visit the Dominos home page$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
 
Then(/^I should see the Dominos home page$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
